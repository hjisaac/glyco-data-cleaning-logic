# Duplicate Analysis
Done using the project PXD035158.

## Goal
Understand how the data is like and at which level is the dataset high quality. Investigate at which point is the data is duplicated

## Motivation
Training a model on a dataset make of the same entry means nothing. And as the distribution of peptides and modified peptides show high peak, 
it means some peptides or their modified versions are repeated many times.  

## Approach
Check duplicates by progressively combining the columns of the dataset.

## Result

Number of lines in the project dataset: 312275
